FuDan University DATA130042.01 Numerical Algorithms with Case Studies I mid-term project

The main content of this project is the real schur decomposition of the matrix, from the traditional two-step displacement to the six-step displacement, and then to the multi-step small block displacement. Finally, the Aggressive Early Deflation method is used to accelerate the convergence.

Find the largest non-negative q and the samllest non-negative p such that:
\[\begin{array}{*{20}{c}}
{H = \left[ {\begin{array}{*{20}{c}}
{{H_{11}}}&{{H_{12}}}&{{H_{13}}}\\
0&{{H_{22}}}&{{H_{23}}}\\
0&0&{{H_{33}}}
\end{array}} \right]}&{\begin{array}{*{20}{c}}
p\\
{n-p-q}\\
q
\end{array}}\\
{\begin{array}{*{20}{c}}
p&{n-p-q}&q
\end{array}}&{}
\end{array}\]
Where \(H_{33}\) is upper quasi-triangular and \(H_{22}\) is unreduced.

For using BLAS 3 performance in QR iteration, we tend to choose more shifts and longer shifts distance each time to update \(Q\), \(H_{12}\) and \(H_{23}\). Unfortunately, if we choose too more shifts every time, the computation will be inaccurate, while a large-bulge will cause m times rounding error to a small-bugle. So we choose small-bulge multishift QR Strategy.

First, we choose \(2m\) shifts and choose a pair of complex conjugate eigenvalues or two real eigenvalues every time, and put it to the appropriate position. This process will construct a medium-sized orthogonal transformation matrice, use it to update the right side of the long strip-like matrix, which can be computed by BLAS 3.

Then, we move the m small-bugles k steps each time, this process will construct a medium-sized orthogonal transformation matrice, use it to update both the right and the top side of the long strip-like matrix, which can be computed by BLAS 3.At the same time, it should be noted that the remaining space may not be enough to move k steps when we are close to the lower right corner.

At last, remove bugles in the order in which they are introduced, use the medium-sized orthogonal transformation matrice to update the top side of the long strip-like matrix. The detailed algorithm see \textbf{Algorithm 6}
\input{Double-shift-chasing-iteration}

Suppose the order of the matrix is n, we can get The amount of calculation done with BLAS 3 is:
\[\begin{array}{l}
2{(3m + 1)^2}(n - 3m - 1) + \sum\limits_{i = 1}^{\frac{{n - 3m - 1}}{k}} {{{(3m + k + 1)}^2}(k(i - 1) + n - 3m - ki - 1)} \\
 = \frac{{n - 3m - 1}}{k}({(3m + k + 1)^2}(n - (3m + k + 1)) + 2k{(3m + 1)^2})
\end{array}\]

The amount of calculation done with BLAS 2 is:
\[{(3m + k + 1)^3}\frac{{n - 3m - 1}}{k} + 2{(3m + 1)^3}\]

Choose \(m = \left\lfloor {\sqrt n } \right\rfloor \)and \(k = 3m\). Then we can simplify the above equation:
\[\begin{array}{l}
BLAS - 2:216{n^2} - 162n\sqrt n \\
BLAS - 3:36{n^2}\sqrt n  - 270{n^2} + 486n\sqrt n 
\end{array}\]

This shows us that the computation in BLAS-3 is much more than BLAS-2 under this choice.
